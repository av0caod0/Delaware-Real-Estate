Our inspiration for this project was the desire to understand the real estate industry and to provide valuable and stategic insights for potential clients in the future. 

We used 10 variables including over 900K+ entries and these variables can be divided into groups based on states.

We used R and RStudio to help us sort through the data and apply multivariate statistics to help us answer 4 main questions.
1. Does the size of the house vary significantly based on zip code?
2. Does the demand of the house vary significantly based on zip code?
3. Does the state or zip code affect the availability of houses that are for sale?
4. How does the size of the lot affect the status of the house?
